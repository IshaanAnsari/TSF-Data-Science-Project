# TSF Task - 2
# Prediction using Unsupervised ML

## From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, I predicted the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. \

### ALGORITHM USED - K-Means

K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.
